Video Downloader is a powerful and user-friendly Windows application that allows you to download videos from YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and 50+ platforms.

### ✨ What's New in v1.7.0 — The Modularity Update

#### 🏗️ Major Architectural Refactoring
- **MainForm.cs reduced by 65%** (2300 → ~800 lines) by extracting:
  - `NativeMethods` — centralized Windows P/Invoke declarations
  - `SettingsManager` — registry-backed settings persistence
  - `DependencyManager` — yt-dlp / FFmpeg detection, download, and installation
  - `ThemeService` — 8-theme engine with `ThemeColors` records
  - `LocalizationService` — in-memory translation engine with safe key fallback
- **Dedicated UI Forms:** `AboutForm`, `SupportedSitesForm`, `SystemCheckForm`
- **Eliminated P/Invoke duplication** across MainForm and YtDlpService

#### 🔒 Security
- **SHA256 checksum verification** for downloaded yt-dlp.exe and FFmpeg binaries
- Hash constants declared in `DependencyVersions.cs` — set them to enable verification
- Shared `HttpClientFactory` with proper timeout and User-Agent headers

#### 🎨 UX Improvements
- **WebP thumbnail support** via SkiaSharp — YouTube thumbnails now display correctly
- **Quality selection modeled as enum** (`QualityOption`) — no more fragile string parsing
- All magic numbers replaced with `AppConstants` for DPI-aware layout management

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Progress parsing fixed:** now uses `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` — works on all locales
- **Race condition resolved** in `YtDlpService` process disposal with lock synchronization
- **Process timeout handling:** zombie processes now killed after metadata timeout
- Removed unused fields in `RoundedButton`

#### 📦 New Dependencies
- `SkiaSharp` + `SkiaSharp.Views.WindowsForms` — cross-format image decoding
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` — structured logging infrastructure

### 📌 Previous Highlights (v1.6.1)

#### ✅ Kick URL Parsing Fix
- Fixed argument parsing issues that could cause valid Kick VOD URLs to fail.

#### 🔧 Dependency Installation Improvements
- Improved startup dependency flow to auto-install standalone `yt-dlp` and `FFmpeg`.

#### 🎨 User Interface
- Modern and clean design
- **8 beautiful themes** (Light, Dark, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Purple, Rose, Midnight)
- Turkish and English language support
- Simple and clear progress display
- Pause and resume downloads

#### ⚙️ Technical
- .NET 8.0 Windows Forms
- yt-dlp (Python video download module)
- FFmpeg (video/audio processing)
- Automatic dependency management

### 📦 Installation (v1.6.1+)

#### Via Microsoft Winget (Recommended)
You can install or update Video Downloader directly from the Windows Package Manager:
```powershell
winget install kayapater.VideoDownloader
```

#### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest `VideoDownloader-v1.6.1-Setup.msi` from the [Releases](https://github.com/kayapater/video-downloader/releases/latest) page.
2. Run the MSI installer.
3. Installer includes bundled `yt-dlp.exe` and `FFmpeg` binaries (`ffmpeg/ffprobe/ffplay`) for offline-ready usage.
4. On startup, the app uses bundled tools first and only falls back to Python/pip-based install when standalone `yt-dlp.exe` is not available.

---

### 🏗️ Architectural Refactoring (SOLID)
- **Modular Design:** Migrated from a monolithic `MainForm.cs` to a modular **Service/Strategy pattern**.
- **Smart Dependency Management:** Improved system for detecting and auto-installing pinned `yt-dlp` and `FFmpeg` dependencies.
- **Pinned Dependency Versions:** Bundled `yt-dlp` and `FFmpeg` versions are declared in `VideoDownloader/DependencyVersions.cs` and exported into `bundled-dependencies.json` during packaging.
