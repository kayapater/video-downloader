## 🔒 Security & Trust

### 🛡️ Why Open Source?

We believe in **transparency over certificates**. Here's why we chose the open source approach:

| 🔓 **Open Source Benefits** | 💰 **Commercial Certificates** |
|:---|:---|
| ✅ **Full Transparency** - See exactly what you're downloading | ❌ **Black Box** - No visibility into what the app does |
| ✅ **Community Reviewed** - Hundreds of developers can review the code | ❌ **Trust Based** - You have to trust the company |
| ✅ **No Vendor Lock-in** - Direct relationship with developers | ❌ **Corporate Control** - Company controls your experience |
| ✅ **Faster Updates** - No store approval delays | ❌ **Slow Updates** - Wait for store approvals |
| ✅ **Cost Effective** - $0 vs $300-600/year for certificates | ❌ **Expensive** - High annual certification costs |

### 🔐 Security Features
